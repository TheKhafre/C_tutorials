PSEUDOCODE:

step 1: declare program variables
	int age;
	int salary;
	int new_salary;

step 2: ask user to enter age.
step 3: save user's entered age in variable age
step 4: ask for user current salary
step 5: save the worker's current salary in variable salary
step 6: if(age >= 60 && salary < 100k) then we increase salary by 10%
	if(age >= 60 && salary > 100k) then we increase salary by 5%
	if(age < 60 && salary < 70k) then we increase salary by 10%
	else print( no increment today)

step 7: save the increment in variable increment as follows
	1. new_salary = salary + (salary * 0.1)
	2. new_salary = salary + (salary * 0.05)
	3. new_salary = salary + (salary * 0.1)

step 8: print your new salary is new_salary
