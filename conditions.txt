	int b = 7;
	int c = 8;
	int d;

PSEUDOCODE
1.Variables:
	- age (x)
	- salary (y)
	- increment (m)

2. conditions:
	x > 60 = 10%
	(x + y) > 60 = m + 5%

	ada
	- x > 60 && y > 100k = (m = y + 10%)
	- x < 60 && y < 70k = (m = y + 5%)
	- x > 60 = (m = y + 10)

	moyin
	- x > 60 && y > 100k = (m = y + 10%)
	- x < 60 && y < 70k = (m = y + 5%)
